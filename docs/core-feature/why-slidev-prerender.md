# Why Slidev Prerender

## The Problem with Slidev Alone

Slidev is a powerful tool for creating presentation slides with markdown, but it has limitations when it comes to sharing on social media and search engine optimization:

### Limited Meta Tag Control

With Slidev alone, you cannot set meta tags individually for each slide. This means:

- All slides share the same Open Graph (OGP) tags
- Social media previews show generic information regardless of which slide is shared
- Search engines cannot properly index individual slides with unique metadata

### Poor Social Media Experience

When you share a Slidev presentation link on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn:

- The preview shows the same generic information for all slides
- Users cannot see what the specific slide is about before clicking
- This reduces engagement and click-through rates

## How Slidev Prerender Solves This

Slidev Prerender converts your Single Page Application (SPA) into a Multi-Page Application (MPA), generating individual HTML files for each slide with customized metadata.

### Per-Slide Customization

- Optimize Twitter Card previews for better social media engagement

### SEO Benefits

- Each slide can rank for different keywords
- Better discoverability through search results

### Enhanced Sharing

- Rich previews on social media platforms
- Users see relevant information before clicking
- Higher engagement and click-through rates
